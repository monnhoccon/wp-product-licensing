WordPress Premium Products Licensing in WooCommerce plugin.

= Introduction =

A simple solution to WordPress premium products licencing. Define API Products separately, then sell licences as products in WooCommerce which grant access to api products.

Please notice that [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) must be installed and active.

= Installation =

Check out our installation guide and configuration of WP Product Licensing tab [Installation](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-product-licensing/installation/).

= Questions? =

You can answer your questions using:

* Our Session [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-product-licensing/faq/).
* Creating a topic in the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-product-licensing) (English only).

= Contribute =

You can contribute to the source code in our [GitHub](https://github.com/axisthemes/wp-product-licensing/) page.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater.
* WooCommerce 2.3 or greater.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WP Product Licensing, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WP Product Licensing” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our licensing plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our WP Product Licensing plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
